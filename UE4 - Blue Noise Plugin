Built from UE4 4.20 fork

The main ideas of the project comes from here:
https://blog.demofox.org/2017/10/20/generating-blue-noise-sample-points-with-mitchells-best-candidate-algorithm/

The white noise generator was made from UE4 blueprint nodes, while the blue noise involved making a custom node.
The code for the custom bluenoise node was wrapped into a plugin.
