Pass Placement Explaination:

  I decided to place my pass after Anti-Aliasing and before Motion Blur 
because I wanted motion blur to not be quantized by the postprocess and look 
normal. It didn't really matter that AA happens before it, my process just
had to be before motion blur.

What works:
all undergrad portions
hooking into postprocessing.cpp
creating sobel edges from colormap
creating sobel edges from depthmap
convert sobel edges to outlines
quantizing luminence

What doesnt work:
deriving a sobel edge from normal
